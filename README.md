👋 Hi, @imuhdork

I have been a java developer for quite some time but want to keep pushing myself to be better.
Admittedly, I am most comfortable in the spring eco-system from the core framework through to
the cloud frameworks.

I am an advocate for, and obsessed with frankly, all things APIs and Events so naturally I prefer
to focus my time on integration and the back end space.

👀 I’m interested in Events/Event-Driven Architecture and APIs/API First

🌱 I’m currently learning
* reactive programming in java
* functional programming in java
* kotlin
* typescript

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on
* anything in the spring eco-system
* cloud native computing foundation cloud events sdk
* content for learning
